## Goals

The R script in this project will produce two tidy, well-labelled, descriptive data sets from the combination of the training and test data sets:
 - one that contains any mean and standard deviation values for each measurement
 - one that contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The second resulting data set will be written ...

*Note, the first resulting data set includes values produced by mean(), meanFreq(), and std().* meanFreq() is included because the assignment specification is vague, and the function starts with "mean."
